# LLMs-finetuning-evaluation

This repo is part of my existing project with Amazon, LLMs for Edge devices. The repo consists of fine-tuning and evaluation scripts for running various state-of-the-art models like LLaMA2, LLaMA3, Gemma and evaluating on open assistant and medico datasets. The scripts can be run on the command line with just few arguments including model id, dataset, LoRA parameters etc. The repo is still under development.
